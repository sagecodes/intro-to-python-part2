### Challenges:
Get the most out of this workshop! We'll sometimes do a "CHALLENGE" where I give you an exercise to do in several minutes. It can be even more effective to partner up with someone next to you, but you can work on your own if you want. No pressure to solve the challenge. I'll share how I would solve it after the time is up.
